# HOW-TO-WATCH-Borussia-Dortmund-and-FC-Barcelona-UEFA





It is already 14 April 2025, and Borussia Dortmund and FC Barcelona have already faced each other in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League Quarter Final tie. Played on 9 April 2025, at the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Barcelona, Barcelona dominated against Dortmund with a 0-4 end result. ​
The return match is April 15, 2025, at Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund. Dortmund cannot be as subdued in their aggregate score (4-0 in the favour of Ajax) and need to cover up the goal deficit in order to be able to advance. ​
Key events ahead of the second leg:
Injuries: Borussia Dortmund’s central defender Nico Schlotterbeck has been ruled out for the season after undergoing surgery for a torn meniscus, and the loss would create a serious dent in Dortmund’s defensive setup. Balde, a left-back for Barcelona's defence, has a hamstring injury which is a three-week absence so that would free him up to miss the two-legged tie in the UCL, as well as other games. ​
Suspensiоn Alert: Barcelona’s Iñigo Martínez is one yellow card away fгom suspension, which would rule him out of the semifinal. This disciplinary matter may impact his minutes next match. ​

Borussia Dortmund will have to do the impossible to be knocked out by Barcelona with the aggregate in their favour now. Dortmund however will be keen to respond after the 0-3 loss with eyes worldwide watching to see if they can craft a response or whether it will be Barcelona who will join Cornellà in the semi-finals.
Team Form
Barcelona: Unbeaten in 2025 in all competitions, with 19 wins and four draws. Now they are leading La Liga and favored to win the Champions League.
Borussia Dortmund: Floundering in the Bundesliga, 8th. They scraped a 2-2 draw at Bayern Munich over the weekend but have some catching up to do in Europe.
Probable Lineups
Borussia Dortmund:
Kobel; Ryerson, Can, Anton, Bensebaini; Gross, Nmecha; Gittens, Brandt, Adeyemi; Guirassy
Barcelona:
Szczesny; Kounde, Araujo, Cubarsi, Martin; Pedri, De Jong; Yamal, Lopez, Raphinha; Lewandowski.
Key Stats
The teams have never met in the UEFA Champions League and Barcelona are unbeaten in six UEFA competition meetings with Borussia Dortmund (W4 D2).
Robert Lewandowski (14) is the player aged 35+ with the most goals in Champions League history.
Lamine Yamal now the youngest player ever to register four goals in Champions League before the age of 18
Match Outlook
Dortmund will need to put in a superhuman effort to cross the finish line. An early goal would tip the momentum in their favour but it will be tough to breach a stolid Barcelona defence.
